        <h2>Our Principles</h2>

We have designed our Privacy Policy and our Data Usage Policy consistent with the following principles (the “Principles”):</p>

            <li>Privacy policies and data collection and use policies should be human readable, comprehensive, and easy to locate;</li>
            <li>Only the minimum amount of information reasonably necessary to provide you with services should be collected and maintained, and only for so long as reasonably needed or required;</li>
            <li>Information you provide through our Services, or that we gather as a result of your use of our Services, should not be used for marketing or advertising purposes, nor should it be provided voluntarily (without your permission) to anyone else unless required; and</li>
            <li>If wanted-tuts.com is required to provide a third party with your personal information (whether by subpoena or otherwise), then provided we have collected and retained an email address for you, wanted-tuts.com will use reasonable means to notify you promptly of that event, unless prohibited by law or WT is otherwise advised<br>
                not to notify you on the advice of legal counsel.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Personal Information WT Collects</h2>
        <p>We may collect personal information through our Services, including without limitation:</p>

            <li>when you provide us with your personal information such as by sending an email to us or signing up to receive updates from wanted-tuts.com;</li>
            <li>when you subscribe to one of our email discussion lists;</li>
            <li>when you donate money to us or purchase merchandise;</li>
            <li>when you create an account;</li>

            <li>when you provide personal information in connection with your participation in any of the forums we make available through our Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What WT Does with Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Emails and Newsletters. We use the personal information you provide to us when you send us emails or sign up to receive updates from wanted-tuts.com in order to respond to your request – for example, to reply to your email or to send you communications about wanted-tuts.com news and campaigns.</p>
        <p>Donations. When you donate money to us or purchase merchandise via our support page, your personal information will be handled depending on which option you choose.</p>
        <h2>Participating in Our Community</h2>
        <p>Registered Users. When you register to obtain a user account on any of the Services (any such person, a “Registered User”), including but not limited to WTID (a universal log-in for all wanted-tuts.com services), you may be asked to provide personal information to create your account and establish a password and profile. We encourage you to<br>
            use an alias or nickname if you are not comfortable providing your legal name. The name or nickname you provide in connection with your account may be used to attribute you in connection with any content you submit to any Service. We also use that personal information to establish and maintain your account, to provide you with the features<br>
            we provide Registered Users, and to email you regarding changes to this policy or other applicable policies. If you sign up to receive updates from wanted-tuts.com when you create your account, we will use your personal information to send you communications about wanted-tuts.com news and campaigns.</p>
        <p>Any other personal information that we may collect which is not described specifically in this Privacy Policy will only be collected and used in accordance with the Principles.</p>
        <h2>Disclosures of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>In general, it is not wanted-tuts.com’ practice to disclose personal information to third parties. Other than providing you with attribution using your WTID nickname in connection with your WT-licensed works, we may share your personal information in two instances:</p>
        <p>First, wanted-tuts.com may share personal information with our contractors and service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the Services.</p>
        <p>Second, we may disclose your personal information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our Master Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public.</p>
        <p>If wanted-tuts.com is required to provide a third party with your personal information (whether by subpoena or otherwise), then provided we have collected and retained an email address for you, wanted-tuts.com will use reasonable means to notify you promptly of that event, unless prohibited by law or WT is otherwise advised not to<br>
            notify you on the advice of legal counsel.</p>
        <h2>Data Usage Policy: Non Personal Browsing and Site Usage Information</h2>
        <p>Our Data Usage Policy covers how we maintain and use information about you that is collected by our Services, including when you log into a website using your wanted-tuts.com OpenID or WTID.</p>
        <h3>Non Personal Browsing Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>When you use the Services, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) may collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of your “IP address”) about your activities while visiting the Websites and information about the browser you are using. In addition, whenever you use your<br>
            wanted-tuts.com OpenID or WTID to log into a website, our servers (which, again, may be hosted by a third party service provider) keep a log of the websites you visit and when you visit them.</p>
        <h3>No Linking</h3>
        <p>We do not intentionally link browsing information or information from our OpenID or WTID server logs to the personal information you submit to us. We use this information for internal purposes only, such as to help understand how the Services are being used, to improve our Services, and for systems administration purposes. WT may use a third party analytics provider to help us collect and analyze non personal browsing information through operation of our Services for those same purposes.</p>
        <h3>No Selling or Sharing</h3>
        <p>Except in the unique situations identified in this Privacy Policy, wanted-tuts.com does not sell or otherwise voluntarily provide the non personal browsing information we collect about you or your website usage to third parties.</p>
        <h3>No Access</h3>
        <p>As an OpenID and WTID service provider, WT could technically access your web-based account tied to our OpenID or WTID service, and could log in on behalf of any of its OpenID or WTID users to any of the accounts they have accessed using their wanted-tuts.com OpenID or WTID. wanted-tuts.com will never use this technical login ability for any purpose unless otherwise required by law.</p>
        <h3>Notice</h3>
        <p>If wanted-tuts.com is required to provide a third party with your non personal browsing information or to log in on behalf of an OpenID or WTID user (whether by subpoena or otherwise), then WT will use reasonable means to notify you promptly of that event, unless WT is prohibited by law from doing so or is otherwise advised not to notify<br>
            you on the advice of legal counsel.</p>
        <p>Any other non-personal information that we collect which is not described specifically in this Privacy Policy will only be collected and used in accordance with the Principles.</p>
        <h2>Reorganization or Spin-Offs</h2>
        <p>wanted-tuts.com may transfer some or all of your personal and/or non personal browsing information to a third party as a result of a reorganization, spin-off, or similar transaction. Upon such transfer, the acquirer’s privacy policy will apply. In such event, wanted-tuts.com will use reasonable efforts to notify you and to ensure that at the time of the transaction the acquirer’s privacy policy complies with the Principles.</p>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>The Services are not directed at children under the age of 13. Consistent with the federal Children’s Online Privacy<br>
            Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without requiring parental consent. Our Master Terms of Use specifically prohibit anyone using our Services from submitting any personally identifiable information about persons under 13 years of age. Any person who provides their personal information to WT through the Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older.</p>
        <h2>Third-Party Sites</h2>
        <p>The Services may include links to other websites. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party sites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other websites.</p>
        <h2>Special Note to International Users</h2>
        <p>The Services are hosted in the United States. Please note that your personal data may be&nbsp; located on servers in the United States. By providing your personal data you consent to the use of your personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with the Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h2>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the Effective Date below. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any<br>
            updates.</p>
